# Mixing Baking Soda and Superglue

To increase the bond strength and shorten the cure of super glue, you can mix it with baking soda. The bicarbonate molecules within baking soda react with superglue to create reactive ions. These reactive ions more easily bond with other molecules in the liquid superglue. This causes longer and stronger crystals of super glue. The quick cure time allows for use in high foot-traffic areas. It also forms a better bond with plastics. The sources are videos of how to apply baking soda to super glue.
